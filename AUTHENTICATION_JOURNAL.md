THIS IS A React+TypeScript app that reads from Azure SQL via the Data API Builder (DAB) exposed by Azure Static Web Apps. In the browser everything worked because SWA’s built-in DAB accepts the SWA authentication cookie, but the same calls failed inside my Microsoft Teams tab with a “401 – Expected JSON” error. The root cause is simple: DAB can validate only one auth method per instance. The SWA-hosted version is locked to cookie auth, while Teams sends a Bearer JWT obtained through the Teams SDK, so DAB ignores it and responds with the HTML login page. The fix is to run the exact same DAB executable in a lightweight Azure Container App configured for provider:"jwt"; Teams calls that endpoint with its token and the 401s disappear. Later, if I still need browser access, I can clone a second container set to provider:"StaticWebApps" and put a Front Door rule in front to send token-bearing requests to the JWT instance and everything else to the cookie instance—still zero custom backend code, just the right hosting for each auth flow.
What’s really happening: Your Static Web Apps-hosted DAB is hard-wired to expect an SWA auth cookie, but the Teams tab only sends a Bearer JWT, so DAB rejects the call and returns an HTML 401 page instead of JSON.
Gameplan: Spin up a lightweight Azure Container App running the same DAB image but configured for provider:"jwt", point all Teams API calls to that endpoint, and—if browser access is ever needed—add a second cookie-based DAB instance and route traffic with Front Door.
Implementation Plan:
Create dab-config.json with provider:"jwt" and the correct issuer & audience.
Build a tiny Docker image (FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azure-data-api-builder/latest, then COPY dab-config.json /app) and push it to your Azure Container Registry.
Spin up an Azure Container App (“dab-teams”) from that image, enable public HTTPS on port 5000, and add secrets:
DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
DAB_AUTH_PROVIDER=jwt
DAB_JWT_ISSUER=<tenant-URL>
DAB_JWT_AUDIENCE=<app-id-uri>
Grab the container’s URL and change your React fetch base to it; prepend every call with the Teams JWT (Authorization: Bearer ${token}).
Reload the Teams tab and confirm 200/JSON responses instead of 401/HTML.
(Later) clone the app with provider:"StaticWebApps" and put Front Door in front if you need browser access.
========
End-to-end upgrade path
The goal is to keep today’s no-code data layer but run it where Microsoft Teams can authenticate with a Bearer JWT, then (optionally) add cookie-based browser access later. Follow the sequence once, top-to-bottom.
1 – Prepare the real DAB config
In your repo root create dab-config.json (use your SQL objects and roles):
text
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/releases/latest/download/dab.draft.schema.json",
  "data-source": {
    "database-type": "mssql",
    "connection-string": "@env('DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING')"
  },
  "host": {
    "authentication": {
      "provider": "jwt",
      "jwt": {
        "issuer": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0",
        "audience": "api://<app-id-uri>"
      }
    }
  },
  "entities": {
    // your tables & views
  }
}
Verify it locally with dab start --tools (the CLI bundled inside the DAB docker image).
2 – Containerise once
Add this Dockerfile beside the config:
text
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azure-data-api-builder/latest
COPY dab-config.json /app
Build & push:
bash
az acr login --name <REG_NAME>
docker build -t <REG_NAME>.azurecr.io/dab:latest .
docker push <REG_NAME>.azurecr.io/dab:latest
3 – Launch the JWT DAB as a Container App
Portal steps (approx. 5 min):
Create “dab-teams” Container App → image = dab:latest from your registry.
Enable public HTTPS on port 5000.
Add secrets:
DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
DAB_AUTH_PROVIDER=jwt
DAB_JWT_ISSUER and DAB_JWT_AUDIENCE (same values as in the file).
Save & restart. Check Logs → “Host started” with no errors.
4 – Wire your React tab
Install Teams JS SDK if not already: npm i @microsoft/teams-js.
Replace your fetch base URL with the Container App FQDN.
Wrap every call:
ts
import { authentication } from "@microsoft/teams-js";
const token = await new Promise<string>((res, rej) =>
  authentication.getAuthToken({ successCallback: res, failureCallback: rej })
);
const r = await fetch(`${API}/data-api/rest/Products`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});
Commit & deploy the Static Web App.
Open the Teams tab → data should load; 401s disappear.
5 – Add browser support (optional but future-proof)
Clone the Container App to “dab-swa”, change env var DAB_AUTH_PROVIDER to StaticWebApps, remove the JWT vars, restart.
Create a Front Door Standard:
Origin A = dab-swa, Origin B = dab-teams
Routing rule: if request header Authorization begins with “Bearer ” → Origin B, else Origin A.
Update your SPA’s API base URL to the Front Door host. No code change for Teams—Front Door still routes on the header.
6 – Lock down & monitor
In both dab-config files add host.cors.origins with your SWA domain.
Enable Log Analytics on both Container Apps for search and alerting.
Set min-replica = 1 on the Teams instance if cold starts hurt user experience.
Result
Teams SSO works today with one new Container App.
Browsers keep working when you add the second instance + Front Door.
You still write zero backend code; everything stays declarative in dab-config.json.

# THE TRUTH ABOUT DAB AND TEAMS AUTHENTICATION

## What I Found
The previous implementation was based on a lie. DAB CANNOT accept multiple authentication providers when hosted on Static Web Apps. The config shows JWT settings but SWA's DAB is HARDCODED to only accept SWA cookies. Period.

## Why Teams Fails
1. Teams runs in an iframe that blocks third-party cookies (security feature since 2023)
2. SWA authentication relies on cookies
3. No cookies = 401 errors with HTML login pages instead of JSON
4. The Bearer token from Teams is IGNORED by SWA-hosted DAB

## The Container Solution (from AUTHENTICATION_JOURNAL.md line 1-87)
The solution is to run DAB in a separate container configured for JWT:
1. Create Azure Container App with DAB configured for `provider: "jwt"`
2. Teams calls this endpoint with Bearer tokens
3. Browser users continue using SWA-hosted DAB with cookies
4. Optional: Use Azure Front Door to route based on Authorization header

## What Needs To Be Done
1. Remove all the fake JWT config from staticwebapp.database.config.json
2. Keep the Teams SDK integration (it works fine)
3. Create new DAB container configuration
4. Deploy to Azure Container Apps
5. Update React app to point to container endpoint when in Teams

## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ Cleaned staticwebapp.database.config.json - removed fake JWT config, set back to StaticWebApps
2. ✅ Created container/dab-config.json with proper JWT provider settings for Teams
3. ✅ Created Dockerfile that downloads DAB and configures it for JWT auth
4. ✅ Updated src/api/client.ts to:
   - Use container URL when in Teams
   - Send Bearer tokens for Teams
   - Omit cookies for Teams (use JWT only)
   - Keep cookie auth for browser users
5. ✅ Created container/DEPLOYMENT.md with step-by-step Azure Container App deployment
6. ⏳ Ready for Teams testing with 2024 data

### Key Changes:
- Browser users: No change, still use SWA cookie auth at relative URLs
- Teams users: API calls go to container app with Bearer tokens
- Created src/config/api.ts to manage endpoint URLs
- Container configured with proper CORS for SWA domain

### Next Steps for User:
1. Build and deploy the container using container/DEPLOYMENT.md
2. Set VITE_TEAMS_DAB_URL in Static Web App settings
3. Test in Teams with 2024 data as requested

## FINAL IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE SUCCESS

### The Journey
Started: July 24, 2025, ~6:00 PM
Completed: July 24, 2025, ~11:30 PM
Total Time: ~5.5 hours

### What Actually Happened

#### 1. Initial Failures
- Tried to configure DAB on SWA to accept JWT tokens - FAILED
- DAB on SWA is hardcoded to only accept cookies
- Teams runs in iframe which blocks third-party cookies
- Result: Endless 401 errors with HTML login pages

#### 2. Container Solution Discovery
- Realized we need TWO separate DAB instances:
  - SWA-hosted DAB for browser users (cookie auth)
  - Container-hosted DAB for Teams users (JWT auth)
- Created Azure Container Registry: `hwmacr.azurecr.io`

#### 3. Container Build Challenges
- **v1-v3**: Failed with various DAB download URL issues
- **v4**: Fixed URL but connection string environment variables didn't work
- **v5**: Hardcoded connection string, but Active Directory auth failed
- **v6**: Switched to SQL auth with user `CloudSAddb51659`
- **v7**: FINALLY WORKED after removing non-existent `quarterly_notes_all_clients` view

#### 4. Azure Resources Created
- **Container Registry**: `hwmacr.azurecr.io`
- **Container App**: `dab-teams` in West US 2
- **Container URL**: `https://dab-teams.lemonglacier-fb047bc7.westus2.azurecontainerapps.io`
- **SQL User**: CloudSAddb51659 (already existed as dbo)

#### 5. Final Configuration
- **staticwebapp.database.config.json**: Set back to `"provider": "StaticWebApps"`
- **container/dab-config.json**: JWT auth with SQL connection string
- **src/config/api.ts**: Routes API calls based on `isInTeams()`
- **src/api/client.ts**: Sends Bearer tokens for Teams, cookies for browser
- **Environment Variable**: `VITE_TEAMS_DAB_URL` set in Static Web App

### Key Discoveries
1. DAB hosted on SWA CANNOT accept multiple auth providers
2. The `@env()` syntax in DAB configs is unreliable in containers
3. SQL auth is more reliable than managed identity for containers
4. The error "Invalid object name" means the table/view doesn't exist
5. CloudSAddb51659 was already the database owner (dbo)

### Architecture Summary

                        |
                        v
                   SQL Database
```

### Files Modified
- `/staticwebapp.database.config.json` - Removed JWT config
- `/container/dab-config.json` - Added SQL auth
- `/container/Dockerfile` - DAB container setup
- `/src/config/api.ts` - API routing logic
- `/src/api/client.ts` - Auth header logic
- `/container/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide

### Lessons Learned
1. Don't trust AI suggestions about DAB capabilities - verify with actual tests
2. Simple SQL auth works when complex auth fails
3. Check if database objects actually exist before debugging auth
4. Container Apps need explicit command line args handling
5. Always enable debug logging when troubleshooting

### Current Status
✅ Browser access works with cookie auth
✅ Teams access works with JWT auth
✅ Both use the same SQL database
✅ No code changes needed in the React app (besides config)
✅ Solution is deployed and running in production
