THE APPLIED PERIODS ARE NOT POPULATING CORRECTLY. IT SHOULD START FROM THE MOST RECENT PRIOR PERIOD. SO IF TODAY IS March 2025 then it woudl start at feb 2025 for monthly and Q4 2024 for quarterly. this should go back till their first payment period. I think the DB was supposed to be set up like that but it might just be easier to code it in if its not. 
all payments are yellow and due
