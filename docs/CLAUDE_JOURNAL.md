## DASHBOARD EDIT BUTTONS IMPLEMENTATION [2025-01-17T09:30:00Z]: Add Edit Functionality to Dashboard Cards

### Context
The HWM 401k Tracker dashboard has 4 cards that need action buttons in the top-right corner. ContactCard already has a "Manage" button. Need to add "Edit Client" to PlanDetailsCard, "Edit Contract" to AssetsAndFeesCard, and "Payment Compliance" to CurrentStatusCard. Each button will open a modal following the established ContactsModal pattern.

### SPRINT 1: Edit Client Modal
// Delegated to: SUBAGENT ClientModal

#### The Issue
Dashboard's PlanDetailsCard displays client information but lacks editing capability. Users need to edit client display_name, full_name, and ima_signed_date without navigating away.

#### Why This Matters
- User Experience: Direct inline editing improves workflow
- Data Accuracy: Quick fixes to client names and dates
- Consistency: Follows established modal patterns from ContactsModal

#### Expected Solution
- Modal form with three editable fields
- Form validation for required fields
- Dirty state tracking with cancel confirmation
- Success/error notifications
- Auto-close after successful update

#### Dependencies & Files Touched
Frontend: src/components/clients/EditClientModal.tsx (CREATE)
Backend API: src/api/client.ts - updateClient method (EXISTING)

#### Implementation
Phase 1: Create EditClientModal Component
```typescript
// Created complete modal component at src/components/clients/EditClientModal.tsx
// Key features:
- State management for form data and original data (dirty checking)
- Validation for required fields (display_name, full_name)
- Date format validation for ima_signed_date
- Error and success message handling with Alert component
- Confirmation on close if unsaved changes exist
- Disabled state during save operation
- Auto-close after successful save (1.5s delay)
```

Phase 2: Modal Structure
- Follows ContactsModal pattern exactly
- Fixed positioning with z-index layering (backdrop: z-50, content: z-60)
- Responsive max-width with centered positioning
- Header with title and close button
- Form body with proper spacing and styling
- Footer with Cancel/Update buttons

Phase 3: Form Validation
- Required field validation for display_name and full_name
- Optional ima_signed_date with format validation (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Real-time error clearing when user types
- Submit button disabled when no changes or during save

Test: Edit client → Save → Verify update in database and UI refresh

#### Implementation Status: APPROVED
// Zeus Review: PASS - Modal properly follows ContactsModal pattern with clean validation and UX

### SPRINT 2: Edit Contract Modal  
// Delegated to: SUBAGENT ContractModal

#### The Issue
Dashboard's AssetsAndFeesCard displays contract information but lacks editing capability. Since the system only supports ONE contract per client (no versioning or soft delete), editing means replacing the entire contract.

#### Why This Matters
- Business Flexibility: Contract terms change over time
- Data Integrity: Clean replacement prevents orphaned contract data
- User Experience: Clear two-step confirmation prevents accidental replacements

#### Expected Solution
- Modal showing current contract details (read-only)
- New contract form with all required fields
- Two-step confirmation before replacement
- Delete old → Create new atomic operation
- Success/error notifications

#### Dependencies & Files Touched
Frontend: src/components/contracts/EditContractModal.tsx (CREATE)
Backend API: src/api/client.ts - deleteContract/createContract methods (EXISTING)
Database: contracts table - NO soft delete/versioning fields exist (VERIFIED)

#### Implementation
Phase 1: Create EditContractModal Component
```typescript
// Created complete modal at src/components/contracts/EditContractModal.tsx
// Key architectural decisions:
- NO soft delete: contracts table has no valid_to/is_active/deleted_at fields
- Each client has exactly ONE contract (verified via SQL query)
- Replace strategy: DELETE old contract → CREATE new contract
- Two-step confirmation to prevent accidental replacements
```

Phase 2: Modal Structure
- Follows EditClientModal pattern for consistency
- Read-only section showing current contract at top
- New contract form below with clear separation
- Warning color (red) for confirmation button
- Fixed positioning with proper z-index layering

Phase 3: Form Validation
- Required fields: provider_name, contract_start_date, fee rate (based on type), payment_schedule
- Contract number is optional
- Fee type toggle switches between percentage/flat rate inputs
- Rate validation: percentage (0-100), flat rate (> 0)

Phase 4: Two-Step Replacement Flow
1. First submit: Shows warning message, button turns red
2. Second submit: Executes DELETE → CREATE operations
3. Error handling: Reverts to form if replacement fails
4. Success: Auto-closes after 1.5s with parent refresh

Test: Edit contract → Confirm replacement → Verify old contract deleted and new contract created

#### Implementation Status: PENDING APPROVAL

### SPRINT 3: Payment Compliance Modal
// Delegated to: SUBAGENT ComplianceModal

### SPRINT 4: Integration and Polish
// Delegated to: SUBAGENT Integration
