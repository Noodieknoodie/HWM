Result: Clean 4-card layout with reusable DashboardCard component, improved responsive design, better null handling

Result: Successfully implemented modal-based contact management with full CRUD functionality

## Implementation Completed:
1. **TypeScript Interface** (src/types/contact.ts)

   - ContactFormData for form handling

2. **API Layer** (src/api/client.ts)
   - Added typed CRUD methods: getContacts, createContact, updateContact, deleteContact
   - Proper ordering by contact_type and contact_name
   - Generic types for proper TypeScript inference

3. **React Hook** (src/hooks/useContacts.ts)
   - Full state management with loading/error handling
   - Automatic refresh after mutations
   - Follows existing patterns from useClientDashboard

4. **UI Components**:
   - **ContactsModal**: Main dialog container with success/error alerts
   - **ContactsTable**: Display all contacts with type badges, inline actions
   - **ContactForm**: Nested dialog for add/edit with validation
   - **Updated ContactCard**: Added "Manage Contacts" button with action prop
   - **Updated GridAlignedCard**: Added action prop support for buttons

5. **Features Implemented**:
   - View all contact types (Primary, Authorized, Provider)
   - Color-coded badges for contact types
   - Add new contacts with validation
   - Edit existing contacts
   - Delete with confirmation
   - Success notifications
   - Proper error handling
   - Responsive modal design

6. **Key Implementation Details**:
   - Modal approach keeps user on dashboard

   - Null handling for optional fields (fax, mailing_address)
   - Form validation for required fields
   - Confirmation dialog for deletions
