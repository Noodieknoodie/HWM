# HWM Test Framework

This test framework is designed to work with the mock data already loaded in the database

HWM 401k Payment Tracker Test Document
Test Strategy Overview
Use the 4 mock clients that span 2021-2025 with different test scenarios applied by year. This approach tests every fee configuration against every edge case systematically.
Mock Client Setup (ALREADY IN DB)
Base Clients (Constant Across All Years)
1. TEST-MONTHLY-FLAT: Monthly schedule, flat fee type
2. TEST-QUARTERLY-FLAT: Quarterly schedule, flat fee type
3. TEST-MONTHLY-PERCENT: Monthly schedule, percentage fee type
4. TEST-QUARTERLY-PERCENT: Quarterly schedule, percentage fee type
Year-Based Test Scenarios
2025 (Jan-June): Clean Baseline + Dashboard Estimation
* All payments correct and on time
* Percentage clients: Mix of provided and missing AUM
    * Jan/Mar/May: Full AUM data
    * Feb/Apr/Jun: No AUM (tests dashboard estimation)
* Purpose: Test current functionality and AUM reverse calculation
2024: Missing AUM Year
* Percentage clients: AUM only provided in Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec
* Flat clients: Normal (but verify variance still calculates without AUM)
* Add edge case: One payment with $0 expected fee
* Purpose: Test estimation, variance blocking, and edge cases
2023: Variance Test Year + Boundaries
* Q1: Exact matches testing $0.01 threshold
    * Small payment: $10 with $9.99 expected (tests dollar threshold)
    * Large payment: $10,000 with $9,999.99 expected (same threshold)
* Q2: 5% over expected (test "acceptable" status)
* Q3: 12% under expected (test "warning" status)
* Q4: 22% over expected (test "alert" status)
* Dec 31 payment: Verify Q4 assignment
* Purpose: Validate all variance thresholds and quarter boundaries
2022: Payment Gap Year + Multi-Payment
* MONTHLY-FLAT: Missing Feb, May, Aug
    * June: TWO payments for same month (test duplicate handling)
* QUARTERLY-FLAT: Missing Q2
* MONTHLY-PERCENT: Missing Mar, Jul, Nov
    * April: $0 payment amount (test validation)
* QUARTERLY-PERCENT: Missing Q3
* Purpose: Test compliance, missing payments, and edge cases
2021: Contract Change Year + Provider Aggregation
* All contracts change July 1, 2021
* First half: Original rates
* Second half: 20% higher rates (new contracts)
* Create 3 clients under same provider for aggregation testing
* Purpose: Test contract history and provider math
Test Execution Matrix
Test Category	Year/Period	What to Verify
Current Period Logic	July 2025	All clients show June 2025 or Q2 2025 as billable
Dashboard AUM Estimate	2025 Feb/Apr	Dashboard shows estimated AUM, calculation = payment/rate
Clean Calculations	2025	All math correct, rollups accurate, Q1 sums Jan/Feb/Mar
AUM Estimation	2024	Percentage: asterisks, "N/A - Est. AUM"; Flat: normal variance
Variance Thresholds	2023 by quarter	Status matches, $0.01 = exact regardless of payment size
Quarter Boundaries	2023 Dec 31	Payment appears in Q4, not Q1 2024
Missing Payments	2022	Gaps show "Missing Payment", compliance % correct
Duplicate Payments	2022 June	Both payments show, summaries handle correctly
Contract Changes	2021 July split	Expected fees use correct rate based on contract
Provider Aggregation	All years	Provider totals = sum of client totals exactly
Automated Test Suite
1. Database Foundation Tests
Test: Arrears Billing Logic
* Query: SELECT current_period_display FROM dashboard_view WHERE client_id IN (test client IDs)
* Pass: In July 2025, monthly clients show "June 2025", quarterly show "Q2 2025"
* Fail: Shows July or Q3
Test: Quarterly Mapping
* Query: SELECT quarter FROM comprehensive_payment_summary WHERE client_id = [TEST-MONTHLY-FLAT] AND year = 2025
* Pass: Jan/Feb/Mar = Q1, Apr/May/Jun = Q2, etc.
* Fail: Incorrect quarter assignment
Test: Quarter Boundaries
* Query: Check Dec 31, 2023 payment quarter assignment
* Pass: Shows in Q4 2023
* Fail: Shows in Q1 2024
2. Calculation Tests
Test: Dashboard AUM Estimation
* Query: Check dashboard_view for TEST-MONTHLY-PERCENT in Feb 2025

* Fail: Flag not set or calculation attempted
Test: Variance Status Assignment
* Query: Check variance_status for all 2023 payments
* Pass: Q1="exact", Q2="acceptable", Q3="warning", Q4="alert"

* Pass: payment_count = 3, total = sum of Apr+May+Jun
* Fail: Wrong count or math
Test: Contract Change Preservation
* Check: 2021 expected fees before/after July
* Pass: First half uses original rate, second half uses new rate
* Fail: Historical data changed or wrong rate applied
Test: Posted Status Independence
* Action: Toggle is_posted for any quarter
* Pass: Only affects checkboxes, not payment data
* Fail: Payment calculations change
4. Validation Tests
Test: Zero Dollar Payment
* Action: Try to save payment with $0 amount
* Pass: Error "Payment amount must be positive"
* Fail: Payment saves
Test: Negative AUM Entry
* Action: Enter -1000 in AUM field
* Pass: Accepts negative (edge case allowed)
* Fail: Validation prevents entry
Test: Future Payment Prevention
* Action: Try to save payment dated tomorrow

5. Export Validation
Test: CSV Export Accuracy
* Export: Q2 2025 summary
* Pass: All test clients present, totals match UI, estimated AUM marked
* Fail: Missing data or calculation differences
Test: Provider Subtotals
* Export: Annual 2021 with multiple providers
* Pass: Provider subtotal rows calculate correctly
* Fail: Manual sum doesn't match exported total
