Add to this after completing significant task or something that should be retained in memory for future Agentic Coding Assistants to see to sppeedline their context understanding. entries should be combined lists, verically compact, repeating structure. 

**EXAMPLE ENTRY:** 
# Task | Timestamp 
Description: blah blah blah
Reason: blah blah blah
Files Touched: blah.poo, pee.ha
Result: blah blah blah
===============================

# Sprint 1 - Foundation & Project Setup | 2025-07-04
Description: Created clean project structure for 401k tracker (React/FastAPI/Teams)
Reason: Starting from empty codebase, avoiding old Teams Toolkit complexity
Files Touched: backend/{main.py,database.py,models.py,requirements.txt}, frontend/{package.json,vite.config.ts,App.tsx}, teams-manifest/manifest.json, README.md
Result: Working foundation with FastAPI backend (port 8000), React frontend (port 5173), simple Teams manifest
Key Notes:
- Database already configured with views/indexes - DO NOT MODIFY
- Using pyodbc with Azure AD auth, Pydantic models match existing schema
- Placeholder routers prevent import errors for future sprints
- Standardized error format: {"error": {"code": "X", "message": "Y"}}
- All dates are proper DATE columns - no string manipulation needed
===============================

# Sprint 2 - Core API Endpoints | 2025-07-04
Description: Implemented client and contract endpoints using database views
Reason: Replace complex manual JOINs with optimized views, eliminate client-side calculations
Files Touched: backend/app/api/clients.py, backend/app/api/contracts.py
Result: Clean API endpoints leveraging database views for all complex queries
Key Implementation Details:
- GET /api/clients uses `clients_by_provider_view` - eliminates manual JOINs and provider grouping
- Binary status only: compliance_status returns "green" or "yellow" (removed red/overdue)
- Contract endpoints validate fee_type consistency (percentage→percent_rate, flat→flat_rate)
- All dates handled as DATE type - no string manipulation
- Soft deletes via valid_to timestamps
Critical for Future Sprints:
- ClientWithStatus model includes compliance_status from view - use this, don't calculate
- Provider grouping happens in SQL ORDER BY - frontend just displays pre-sorted data
- Contract validation ensures either percent_rate OR flat_rate is set based on fee_type
