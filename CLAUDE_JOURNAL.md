Add to this after completing significant task or something that should be retained in memory for future Agentic Coding Assistants to see to sppeedline their context understanding. entries should be combined lists, verically compact, repeating structure. 

**EXAMPLE ENTRY:** 
# Task | Timestamp 
Description: blah blah blah
Reason: blah blah blah
Files Touched: blah.poo, pee.ha
Result: blah blah blah
===============================


# Sprint 1 - Foundation & Project Setup | 2025-07-04
Description: Created clean project structure for 401k tracker (React/FastAPI/Teams)
Reason: Starting from empty codebase, avoiding old Teams Toolkit complexity
Files Touched: backend/{main.py,database.py,models.py,requirements.txt}, frontend/{package.json,vite.config.ts,App.tsx}, teams-manifest/manifest.json, README.md
Result: Working foundation with FastAPI backend (port 8000), React frontend (port 5173), simple Teams manifest
Key Notes:
- Database already configured with views/indexes - DO NOT MODIFY
- Using pyodbc with Azure AD auth, Pydantic models match existing schema
- Placeholder routers prevent import errors for future sprints
- Standardized error format: {"error": {"code": "X", "message": "Y"}}
- All dates are proper DATE columns - no string manipulation needed
===============================

# Sprint 2 - Core API Endpoints | 2025-07-04
Description: Implemented client and contract endpoints using database views
Reason: Replace complex manual JOINs with optimized views, eliminate client-side calculations
Files Touched: backend/app/api/clients.py, backend/app/api/contracts.py
Result: Clean API endpoints leveraging database views for all complex queries
Key Implementation Details:
- GET /api/clients uses `clients_by_provider_view` - eliminates manual JOINs and provider grouping
- Binary status only: compliance_status returns "green" or "yellow" (removed red/overdue)
- Contract endpoints validate fee_type consistency (percentage→percent_rate, flat→flat_rate)
- All dates handled as DATE type - no string manipulation
- Soft deletes via valid_to timestamps
Critical for Future Sprints:
- ClientWithStatus model includes compliance_status from view - use this, don't calculate
- Provider grouping happens in SQL ORDER BY - frontend just displays pre-sorted data
- Contract validation ensures either percent_rate OR flat_rate is set based on fee_type
===============================

# Sprint 3 - Payment Management & Smart Periods | 2025-07-04
Description: Implemented payment CRUD endpoints and smart periods using database views
Reason: Replace 150+ lines of period generation and variance calculations with simple SQL queries
Files Touched: backend/app/api/payments.py, backend/app/api/periods.py, backend/app/main.py
Result: Clean payment management with all calculations in SQL views
Key Implementation Details:
- GET /api/payments?client_id={id} uses payment_variance_view for variance data
- POST/PUT/DELETE /api/payments with single period support only (no split payments)
- GET /api/periods queries payment_periods table directly (no dynamic generation)
- All payment responses include variance_amount, variance_percent, variance_status from view
- Soft deletes via valid_to timestamp
- Database triggers handle client_metrics updates automatically
Critical for Future Sprints:
- Expected fees come from database views - NEVER calculate in code
- Period dropdown uses /api/periods endpoint - instant loading
- Frontend must display variance data as-is from API (no calculations)
- Dashboard endpoint (Sprint 4) can leverage payment_variance_view for summary data
===============================

# Sprint 4 PRE-CODE - Dashboard & Payment Status | 2025-07-04
EVAL: Ready to implement unified dashboard endpoint
Reason: All views in place, need single-query dashboard data aggregation
Key Observations:
- client_payment_status view provides current period & payment status
- clients_by_provider_view gives compliance status (already used in Sprint 2)
- payment_variance_view has payment history with variance (already used in Sprint 3)
- Dashboard needs to combine all data in single efficient query
Plan:
- Create GET /api/dashboard/{client_id} returning all dashboard card data
- Use SQL views for ALL data (no Python calculations)
- Binary status only: "Paid" (green) or "Due" (yellow)
- Include recent payments, current period info, compliance status
===============================

# Sprint 4 - Dashboard & Payment Status | 2025-07-04
Description: Implemented unified dashboard endpoint using optimized database views
Reason: Eliminate multiple API calls, provide complete dashboard data in single response
Files Touched: backend/app/models.py (added 7 dashboard models), backend/app/api/dashboard.py
Result: Single GET /api/dashboard/{client_id} endpoint returning all dashboard data
Key Implementation Details:
- Main query uses clients_by_provider_view + client_payment_status + client_metrics
- Recent payments from payment_variance_view include variance data
- Binary status only: "Paid" (green) or "Due" (yellow) - no red/overdue
- Period formatting: "January 2025" (monthly) or "Q1 2025" (quarterly)
- Quarterly summaries from quarterly_summaries table for current year
- All calculations done in SQL views - zero calculations in Python
Critical for Future Sprints:
- Dashboard response includes everything frontend needs (no extra calls)
- Expected fee comes from client_payment_status view
- Compliance color/reason derived from payment_status
- Recent payments include variance_amount, variance_percent, variance_status
- Frontend can display all dashboard cards with single API call
===============================

# Sprint 5 PRE-CODE - Authentication & Teams Integration | 2025-07-04
Description: Implement Azure AD JWT validation and Teams SSO
Reason: Secure all API endpoints and enable Teams authentication
Observations:
- API endpoints unprotected despite Azure AD database auth
- MSAL packages pre-installed but no auth implementation
- Teams manifest needs Azure AD app IDs
Plan:
- Backend: JWT validation middleware with Depends(require_auth)
- Frontend: AuthProvider with silent SSO, useAuth hook, ApiClient
- Manifest: Simple static tab, no Teams Toolkit complexity
===============================

# Sprint 5 - Authentication & Teams Integration | 2025-07-04
Description: Implemented Azure AD authentication and Teams SSO
Reason: Secure API endpoints with JWT validation, enable seamless Teams auth
Files Touched: backend/app/auth.py, backend/app/api/*.py (all endpoints), frontend/src/auth/*, frontend/src/api/client.ts, teams-manifest/manifest.json
Result: Complete auth system - JWT validation backend, MSAL SSO frontend
Key Implementation:
- auth.py validates JWTs using Azure AD public keys
- All endpoints protected with user: TokenUser = Depends(require_auth)
- GET /auth/config provides dynamic auth configuration
- AuthProvider handles Teams SSO automatically
- ApiClient includes bearer token in all requests
Critical for Future Sprints:
- Use useApiClient() hook for all API calls (auth handled automatically)
- Access user via useAuth() hook: {id, email, name, tenantId}
- Teams SSO works automatically - no manual login needed
- Environment vars: AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID (backend), VITE_API_URL (frontend)
===============================

# Sprint 6 PRE-CODE - Frontend Foundation & Routing | 2025-01-04
EVAL: Ready to build React app structure on existing foundation
Reason: Auth complete, need UI structure for client management
Key Observations:
- Foundation solid: React+Vite+TS configured, Tailwind ready, auth working
- React Router DOM v7.1.1 installed but no routes defined
- Zustand v5.0.2 installed but no stores created
- No component structure yet - blank slate for UI
- Old code shows: LaunchMenu, PageLayout, Header, document viewer pattern
Plan:
- Create component directories: components/, pages/, stores/
- Router setup: Home (LaunchMenu), Payments, Documents routes
- PageLayout wrapper with Header navigation
- LaunchMenu with only Payments module enabled
- Zustand store: selectedClient, documentViewerOpen, apiBase
- Responsive design matching old UI patterns
===============================

# Sprint 6 - Frontend Foundation & Routing | 2025-01-04
Description: Implemented React app structure with routing and global state
Reason: Foundation needed for client management UI in upcoming sprints
Files Touched: App.tsx, stores/useAppStore.ts, components/{PageLayout,Header,LaunchMenu}.tsx, pages/{Home,Payments,Documents}.tsx
Result: Working React app with navigation, state management, and module selection
Key Implementation:
- Routes: / (LaunchMenu), /payments, /documents with PageLayout wrapper
- Zustand store tracks: selectedClient, documentViewerOpen, apiBase
- LaunchMenu shows 3 modules - only Payments enabled
- Header shows nav links, selected client, document viewer toggle
- Document viewer slides in from right (placeholder UI)
- Responsive layout adjusts when document viewer open
Critical for Future Sprints:
- Sprint 7 needs client sidebar - use selectedClient from store
- Document viewer toggle ready - just placeholder content
- Payments page checks for selectedClient - shows warning if none
- All components use Tailwind classes from old UI patterns
- Navigation highlights active route with blue underline
===============================
