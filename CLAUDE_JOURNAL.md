# Sprint 2 Completion | 2025-07-08
Description: Refactored entire frontend data layer to use Azure data-api
Reason: Remove overcomplicated patterns and leverage Azure's standardized REST endpoints
Files Touched: api/client.ts (rewritten), all hooks updated, errorUtils.ts simplified, Sidebar.tsx updated
Result: Clean data layer with no manual refresh logic, simplified error handling, direct SQL view access

Key Changes:
1. **New DataApiClient**:
   - Uses /data-api/rest/ endpoints
   - Leverages Azure's OData filtering ($filter, $orderby)
   - Removes all backend URL configuration
   - No more credentials: 'include' (Azure handles auth)

2. **Simplified Hooks**:
   - usePayments: Removed 3x duplicated refresh logic, now uses refreshKey pattern
   - useClientDashboard: Fetches from multiple views in parallel instead of aggregated endpoint
   - usePeriods: No longer needs contractId, uses available_payment_periods view directly
   - All hooks now handle Azure's standardized error format

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Reduced errorUtils.ts from 53 lines to 24 lines
   - Removed nested error extraction logic
   - Now just handles Azure's {error: {code, message}} format

4. **Data Patterns**:
   - No more manual query parameter building
   - Trust SQL views for all calculations and formatting
   - Removed type casting, proper typing throughout
   - Let Azure handle pagination and filtering

# Sprint 2 Audit Findings | 2025-07-08
Description: Analyzed frontend code for overcomplicated data handling
Reason: Identify simplification opportunities before refactoring
Files Touched: Reviewed api/client.ts, all hooks, errorUtils.ts
Result: Found multiple areas of unnecessary complexity

Key Findings:
1. **Overcomplicated Error Handling**: 
   - Custom ApiError interface with nested structure
   - Complex error extraction in errorUtils.ts
   - Redundant error wrapping in hooks
   
2. **Brute Force Data Patterns**:
   - Manual refresh after every mutation (3x code duplication in usePayments)
   - Manual query parameter building everywhere
   - Type casting instead of proper typing
   
3. **Backend Dependencies**:
   - VITE_API_URL environment variable
   - Manual URL construction
   - Cookie-based auth with credentials: 'include'
   
4. **Data Transformation Issues**:
   - Dashboard endpoint aggregates multiple tables (should be a view)
   - Client-side joins in Payment interface
   - Manual period formatting

Plan: Replace entire API layer with thin Azure data-api wrapper

# Sprint 2 Audit Findings | 2025-07-08
Description: Analyzed frontend code for overcomplicated data handling
Reason: Identify simplification opportunities before refactoring
Files Touched: Reviewed api/client.ts, all hooks, errorUtils.ts
Result: Found multiple areas of unnecessary complexity

Key Findings:
1. **Overcomplicated Error Handling**: 
   - Custom ApiError interface with nested structure
   - Complex error extraction in errorUtils.ts
   - Redundant error wrapping in hooks
   
2. **Brute Force Data Patterns**:
   - Manual refresh after every mutation (3x code duplication in usePayments)
   - Manual query parameter building everywhere
   - Type casting instead of proper typing
   
3. **Backend Dependencies**:
   - VITE_API_URL environment variable
   - Manual URL construction
   - Cookie-based auth with credentials: 'include'
   
4. **Data Transformation Issues**:
   - Dashboard endpoint aggregates multiple tables (should be a view)
   - Client-side joins in Payment interface
   - Manual period formatting

Plan: Replace entire API layer with thin Azure data-api wrapper

===============================

# Azure Static Web App Migration Plan | 2025-07-08
Description: Complete architectural migration from Python/FastAPI backend to Azure Static Web Apps with direct database connections
Reason: Eliminate unnecessary backend complexity, reduce maintenance overhead, leverage Azure's managed database API layer
Files Touched: All backend files (to be removed), frontend API layer (to be updated), new SWA configuration files
Result: Simplified architecture with React frontend directly accessing SQL via Azure's /data-api endpoints

**SPRINT 1: SCORCHED EARTH & SCAFFOLDING**
Objective: Remove all legacy code, establish clean file structure
Tasks:
- Delete entire backend/ directory (Python/FastAPI)
- Remove OLD_CODE_A/, OFFICIAL_DOCS/, SPRINT_MODE/ directories
- Remove all Python scripts (db_query.py, generate_schema.py, test_*.py)
- Remove backend startup scripts (activate-linux-venv.sh, backend_start.sh, frontend_start.bat)
- Create swa-db-connections/ directory
- Initialize staticwebapp.database.config.json with entity mappings for all views/tables
- Update .gitignore to remove Python-specific entries
- Create new swa-cli.config.json for local development
- Update README.md to reflect new architecture
Tests: Verify file structure matches target, ensure git status shows clean removal

**SPRINT 2: CODE AUDIT & DATA LAYER REFACTOR**
Objective: Simplify frontend data handling, implement /data-api calls
Audit Focus:
- Review all hooks (useClientDashboard, usePayments, usePeriods) for overcomplicated data transforms
- Check api/client.ts for any brute-force error handling or retry logic
- Identify any client-side data joining that SQL views already handle
- Look for redundant state management in useAppStore.ts
Implementation:
- Update api/client.ts to use /data-api/rest/[entity] endpoints
- Map frontend API calls to new entity names from staticwebapp.database.config.json
- Remove any client-side calculations that duplicate SQL view logic
- Simplify error handling to match Azure's standardized error responses
- Update authentication flow to use StaticWebApps provider
- Remove any backend health checks or connection pooling logic
Tests: Component tests for each updated hook, verify data flows correctly from DB to UI

**SPRINT 3: FINAL CLEANUP & DEPENDENCY PURGE**
Objective: Ensure zero backwards dependencies, production-ready state
Tasks:
- Audit package.json for any backend-related dependencies (remove axios interceptors if overly complex)
- Remove any environment variables related to backend URLs
- Ensure all API calls use relative paths (/data-api/*)
- Update CI/CD to remove backend build/deploy steps
- Verify staticwebapp.config.json has proper routing rules
- Add database connection to Azure Portal for production
- Create comprehensive .env.example for local development
- Final sweep for any comments referencing "backend", "FastAPI", or old architecture
Tests: Full E2E test of payment flow, verify Teams integration works, test all CRUD operations
Production Checklist:
- Database firewall rules configured
- All SQL views tested with SWA data-api
- Authentication working in Teams context
- No console errors or failed requests
- Performance baseline established

**Key Principles Throughout:**
- If a SQL view already calculates it, don't recalculate in JavaScript
- Trust Azure's error handling instead of building complex retry logic
- Keep the UI components untouched - only modify data layer
- Test after each major deletion to ensure nothing breaks
- Document any non-obvious entity mappings in FRONTEND-DB-GUIDE.md

# Sprint 2 Completion | 2025-07-08
Description: Refactored entire frontend data layer to use Azure data-api
Reason: Remove overcomplicated patterns and leverage Azure's standardized REST endpoints
Files Touched: api/client.ts (rewritten), all hooks updated, errorUtils.ts simplified, Sidebar.tsx updated
Result: Clean data layer with no manual refresh logic, simplified error handling, direct SQL view access

Key Changes:
1. **New DataApiClient**:
   - Uses /data-api/rest/ endpoints
   - Leverages Azure's OData filtering ($filter, $orderby)
   - Removes all backend URL configuration
   - No more credentials: 'include' (Azure handles auth)

2. **Simplified Hooks**:
   - usePayments: Removed 3x duplicated refresh logic, now uses refreshKey pattern
   - useClientDashboard: Fetches from multiple views in parallel instead of aggregated endpoint
   - usePeriods: No longer needs contractId, uses available_payment_periods view directly
   - All hooks now handle Azure's standardized error format

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Reduced errorUtils.ts from 53 lines to 24 lines
   - Removed nested error extraction logic
   - Now just handles Azure's {error: {code, message}} format

# Sprint 2 Audit Findings | 2025-07-08
Description: Analyzed frontend code for overcomplicated data handling
Reason: Identify simplification opportunities before refactoring
Files Touched: Reviewed api/client.ts, all hooks, errorUtils.ts
Result: Found multiple areas of unnecessary complexity

Key Findings:
1. **Overcomplicated Error Handling**: 
   - Custom ApiError interface with nested structure
   - Complex error extraction in errorUtils.ts
   - Redundant error wrapping in hooks
   
2. **Brute Force Data Patterns**:
   - Manual refresh after every mutation (3x code duplication in usePayments)
   - Manual query parameter building everywhere
   - Type casting instead of proper typing
   
3. **Backend Dependencies**:
   - VITE_API_URL environment variable
   - Manual URL construction
   - Cookie-based auth with credentials: 'include'
   
4. **Data Transformation Issues**:
   - Dashboard endpoint aggregates multiple tables (should be a view)
   - Client-side joins in Payment interface
   - Manual period formatting

Plan: Replace entire API layer with thin Azure data-api wrapper
