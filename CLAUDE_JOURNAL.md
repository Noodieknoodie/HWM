# Task: Implement Dual Authentication Strategy for Teams Compatibility
# Date: 2025-01-24

## Summary
The app was completely broken in Microsoft Teams due to third-party cookie restrictions. Implemented dual authentication to support both browser (cookie) and Teams (Bearer token) contexts.

## Context & Reasoning
Teams blocks third-party cookies in iframes (security feature since 2023), causing authentication redirect loops (AADSTS50058 errors). The previous "simplification" that removed Teams-specific handling was fundamentally flawed - Teams REQUIRES Bearer tokens. 

Key discovery: Data API Builder (DAB) already supports multiple authentication providers simultaneously. This means we can have cookie auth for browsers AND JWT validation for Teams using the same endpoints.

## Files Affected
- src/teamsAuth.ts
- swa-db-connections/staticwebapp.database.config.json
- src/api/client.ts
- src/auth/useAuth.ts

## Implementation Notes
1. Created proper Teams SDK integration module with token retrieval
2. Updated DAB config to accept both StaticWebApps and JWT providers
3. Modified API client to conditionally send Bearer tokens when in Teams context
4. Updated auth hook to detect Teams environment and use appropriate auth flow
5. Browser users continue with unchanged cookie auth, Teams users get tokens via SDK

## Expected Outcome
- Browser users: No change, cookie auth works as before
- Teams users: Successful authentication via Bearer tokens, no redirect loops
- Mobile Teams: Full functionality restored
- Same API endpoints work for both auth methods
