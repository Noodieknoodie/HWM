## INIT-AGENT – Cross-Stack Logic Analysis

### CRITICAL ISSUES (must-fix, 89%+ confidence)

- [backend/app/api/periods.py]: Mismatched query parameter vs actual parameter used
  - WHY: Line 13-15 expects `payment_schedule` as a query parameter, but line 88 uses this parameter directly in SQL query. However, the frontend `/frontend/src/hooks/usePeriods.ts` sends `contract_id` as a parameter (line 34), NOT `payment_schedule`
  - EFFECT: Frontend sends `/periods?client_id=X&contract_id=Y` but backend expects `/periods?client_id=X&payment_schedule=monthly`, causing 422 validation errors when frontend tries to fetch periods

- [backend/app/api/payments.py]: Missing valid_from and valid_to fields in PaymentWithVariance response
  - WHY: The PaymentWithVariance model inherits from Payment which includes valid_from/valid_to fields (models.py line 103-108), but the SQL query in payments.py doesn't select these fields (lines 20-39)
  - EFFECT: When creating/updating payments, the API returns incomplete data causing potential TypeScript errors or missing data in frontend

- [backend/app/auth.py vs frontend/src/auth/useAuth.ts]: Complete authentication mismatch
  - WHY: Backend expects Azure Static Web Apps headers (X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL) but frontend is using a completely different auth approach with /.auth/me endpoint and no headers are being sent
  - EFFECT: In production, all API calls will fail with 401 errors because frontend never sends the X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL header that backend requires

- [frontend/src/api/client.ts]: API base URL mismatch
  - WHY: Line 3 defaults to '/api' but all backend routes are prefixed with '/api' already (main.py lines 141-145), resulting in calls to `/api/api/clients`
  - EFFECT: All API calls fail with 404 errors in production

- [backend/app/api/dashboard.py]: Database instance created inside route handler
  - WHY: Line 33 creates a new Database() instance inside the route handler instead of using the global `db` instance from app.database
  - EFFECT: Creates new database connections on every request, potentially exhausting connection pool and causing 500 errors under load

### STRONGLY ADVOCATED IMPROVEMENTS

- [backend/app/api/payments.py]: Query parameter pagination ignored
  - WHY: The usePayments hook sends page/limit/year parameters (lines 82-90 in usePayments.ts) but the backend payments endpoint completely ignores these parameters and returns all payments
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Add pagination support to match frontend expectations or remove pagination from frontend

- [backend/app/models.py vs frontend types]: Type mismatches for nullable fields
  - WHY: Backend models use Optional[T] for nullable fields but frontend types don't consistently mark fields as nullable (e.g., total_assets in Payment interface)
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Align nullable field definitions between backend and frontend to prevent runtime type errors

- [backend error responses]: Inconsistent error response format
  - WHY: Some endpoints use create_error_response() helper, others throw HTTPException with plain strings, causing frontend to handle errors inconsistently
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Standardize all error responses to use create_error_response()

### OPTIONAL CLEANUPS

- [frontend/src/stores/useAppStore.ts]: Unused apiBase configuration
  - CONTEXT: Lines 23-24 and 38-39 define apiBase configuration but it's never used; client.ts has its own hardcoded value

- [backend/app/database.py]: Connection string has default value in code
  - CONTEXT: Line 12-15 includes a hardcoded connection string which could accidentally expose production credentials if env var is missing

## FASTAPI-AGENT – Backend Audit

### CRITICAL ISSUES (must-fix, 89%+ confidence)

- [/backend/app/database.py]: No connection pooling or retry logic
  - WHY: Database connections are created fresh each time without pooling, and there's no retry mechanism for transient failures
  - EFFECT: Dev sees occasional 500 errors when Azure SQL has brief connectivity issues; users see "Internal Server Error" during high load or network blips

- [/backend/app/api/payments.py]: Wrong error response format in HTTPException details
  - WHY: Lines 67, 81, 89, 161, 261, 292 pass `create_error_response()` result as detail string, but it returns a dict
  - EFFECT: Dev sees malformed error responses; API returns invalid JSON structure causing frontend parsing errors

- [/backend/app/main.py]: Missing request/response validation models in routes
  - WHY: Root endpoint (line 82) and auth config endpoint (line 93) return raw dicts without Pydantic response models
  - EFFECT: No OpenAPI documentation for these endpoints, no response validation, frontend gets unpredictable response structure

- [/backend/app/api/dashboard.py]: Database instance created inside endpoint
  - WHY: Line 33 creates new `Database()` instance instead of using global `db` from database.py
  - EFFECT: Breaks connection management pattern, could cause token refresh issues, wastes resources creating redundant credential objects

### STRONGLY ADVOCATED IMPROVEMENTS

- [/backend/app/database.py]: Token acquisition happens on every connection
  - WHY: Getting Azure AD token for each connection is expensive and could hit rate limits
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Cache tokens until near expiry, implement token refresh logic

- [/backend/app/auth.py]: Development bypass prints sensitive headers
  - WHY: Lines 29-33 print ALL request headers including potential auth tokens to console
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Remove debug prints or filter sensitive headers before logging

- [/backend/app/api/*.py]: Inconsistent error handling patterns
  - WHY: Some endpoints use `create_error_response()`, others use plain strings, different status codes for similar errors
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Standardize all error responses to use consistent format and status codes

- [/backend/app/models.py]: Missing validation constraints on numeric fields
  - WHY: No min/max constraints on financial fields like `percent_rate`, `flat_rate`, `total_assets`
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Add Field constraints to prevent negative fees, rates over 100%, etc.

- [/backend/app/api/clients.py]: SQL injection risk in dynamic query building
  - WHY: Line 169 uses f-string to build SQL with column names from user input
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Use parameterized queries or validate field names against whitelist

### OPTIONAL CLEANUPS

- [/backend/app/main.py]: Redundant error response creation in exception handlers
  - CONTEXT: Could simplify by having exception handlers return the error dict directly

- [/backend/app/api/periods.py]: Complex query could be a stored procedure
  - CONTEXT: The unpaid periods query is complex and would benefit from being a database view

- [/backend/test_backend.py]: Test file in production code
  - CONTEXT: Should be in a separate tests directory to avoid deployment confusion

## NODE-AGENT – Tooling Audit

### CRITICAL ISSUES (must-fix, 89%+ confidence)

- [/package.json]: Missing package-lock.json file in root directory
  - WHY: The root package.json has concurrently as a devDependency but no lock file exists. This causes npm to install unpinned versions which can differ between environments.
  - EFFECT: Developers might get different versions of concurrently, causing the npm run dev command to behave differently. In production builds, this could cause unexpected build failures.

- [/package.json]: Backend script hardcoded to Linux-specific virtual environment path
  - WHY: Line 11 uses `./.venv-linux/bin/python` which will fail on Windows/Mac systems or if the venv has a different name
  - EFFECT: Developers on Windows/Mac cannot run `npm run dev` - they get "file not found" errors. The start-all.bat uses `.venv\Scripts\activate` which is inconsistent.

- [/frontend/staticwebapp.config.json]: Typo in closing brace - extra closing brace at line 28
  - WHY: JSON syntax error - there's an extra `}` at the end of the file
  - EFFECT: Azure Static Web Apps deployment will fail with JSON parse error, causing 500 errors in production

### STRONGLY ADVOCATED IMPROVEMENTS

- [/frontend/package.json]: Using React 19.1.0 which is extremely new (released Jan 2025)
  - WHY: React 19 is bleeding edge with potential stability issues. Most ecosystem packages may not be compatible yet.
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Downgrade to React 18.x which is stable and battle-tested, unless React 19 features are absolutely required

- [/frontend/tailwind.config.js]: Using CommonJS syntax (module.exports) in an ESM project
  - WHY: Frontend package.json has "type": "module" but Tailwind config uses CommonJS. This creates module resolution confusion.
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Convert to ESM syntax: `export default { ... }`

- [/swa-cli.config.json]: API location points to "backend" but no static build output configured
  - WHY: Azure SWA expects built API functions, not a running Python server. The config assumes backend is deployable as-is.
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Either configure proper Azure Functions or clarify this is dev-only config

### OPTIONAL CLEANUPS

- [/package.json]: Scripts could use cross-platform compatibility
  - CONTEXT: Current scripts won't work across OS platforms. Using cross-env and configuring Python detection would make onboarding smoother.

- [/frontend/vite.config.ts]: Proxy target differs from swa-cli.config.json API URL  
  - CONTEXT: Vite proxy uses localhost:8000 while SWA config uses 127.0.0.1:8000. While functionally equivalent, consistency reduces confusion.

- [/frontend/package.json]: No test scripts defined
  - CONTEXT: Having at least a placeholder test script prevents "no test specified" errors in CI/CD pipelines

## REACT19-AGENT – React Component Audit

### CRITICAL ISSUES (must-fix, 89%+ confidence)

- **/frontend/src/hooks/usePeriods.ts**: Missing apiClient dependency in useEffect
  - WHY: The useEffect hook at line 45 uses `apiClient` but doesn't include it in the dependency array. This could cause stale closures if apiClient changes.
  - EFFECT: Silent failures where API calls use outdated client instances, potentially causing 500 errors or incorrect API endpoint calls.

- **/frontend/src/hooks/usePayments.ts**: Memory leak from unhandled async operations
  - WHY: The `createPayment`, `updatePayment`, and `deletePayment` functions perform async operations after the initial API call without checking if the component is still mounted.
  - EFFECT: If user navigates away during these operations, setState calls will execute on unmounted components, causing memory leaks and React warnings.

- **/frontend/src/hooks/useClientDashboard.ts**: Missing apiClient dependency in useEffect
  - WHY: The useEffect hook at line 119 uses `apiClient` but doesn't include it in the dependency array.
  - EFFECT: Could use stale API client instance, leading to incorrect API calls.

### STRONGLY ADVOCATED IMPROVEMENTS

- **/frontend/src/components/payment/PaymentForm.tsx**: Race condition with periods loading
  - WHY: Form can be submitted while periods are still loading (lines 111-114 only show error but don't prevent submission). The check happens inside the submit handler after validation.
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Disable submit button when periodsLoading is true, preventing race conditions entirely.

- **/frontend/src/components/ClientSearch.tsx**: Potential memory leak in search filtering
  - WHY: The useEffect at line 24 updates state based on props without cleanup. If the component receives rapid prop updates, this could cause excessive re-renders.
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Debounce the search term changes or use useMemo for filtered results.

- **/frontend/src/api/client.ts**: Type safety issues with 'any' types
  - WHY: All API methods use `any` type for data parameters (lines 58, 65, 83, 90, 102, 109), removing TypeScript's type safety benefits.
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Define proper interfaces for each API method's payload.

- **/frontend/src/components/PageLayout.tsx**: Direct store access in render
  - WHY: Line 34 calls `useAppStore.getState()` directly in the render method, bypassing React's reactivity system.
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Use the hook properly: `const { setDocumentViewerOpen } = useAppStore()`.

### OPTIONAL CLEANUPS

- **/frontend/src/App.tsx**: Future flags for React Router
  - CONTEXT: The future flags on lines 65-67 are preparation for React Router v7, which is good practice but could be documented better.

- **/frontend/src/components/payment/PaymentHistory.tsx**: Hardcoded month array bounds check
  - CONTEXT: Line 46 uses Math.min/max to bound the month index, but this could be cleaner with a modulo operation or proper validation.

- **/frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx**: Inefficient client grouping
  - CONTEXT: The `groupClientsByProvider` function recreates the grouped structure on every render. Could benefit from useMemo.

- **/frontend/src/stores/useAppStore.ts**: Unused apiBase state
  - CONTEXT: The apiBase state and setApiBase (lines 23-24, 38-39) appear to be unused - the API client uses import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL directly.

## TAILWIND-AGENT – Styling Audit

### CRITICAL ISSUES (must-fix, 89%+ confidence)

- /frontend/src/components/PageLayout.tsx: Document viewer has mobile usability problems
  - WHY: The fixed positioned document viewer with w-96 (24rem) width will completely cover the screen on mobile devices when open, making the app unusable
  - EFFECT: User cannot interact with main content on mobile when document viewer is open, must close it to see anything else

- /frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx: Missing mobile responsive behavior for sidebar
  - WHY: The sidebar has a fixed width of w-80 (20rem) with no mobile collapse/overlay behavior, causing horizontal overflow on small screens
  - EFFECT: On mobile devices, the sidebar will push content off-screen or create horizontal scroll, breaking the layout

### STRONGLY ADVOCATED IMPROVEMENTS

- /frontend/src/index.css: Duplicate animation definitions
  - WHY: Animations fadeIn and slideUp are defined both in CSS and in tailwind.config.js, causing redundancy and potential conflicts
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Remove CSS @keyframes and use only Tailwind's animation utilities for consistency

- /frontend/src/components/Header.tsx: Mobile navigation lacks proper touch targets
  - WHY: The mobile nav items in the overflow-x-auto container have small tap targets and no visual separation
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Add proper padding and min-width to mobile nav items for better touch usability

- /frontend/src/components/ClientSearch.tsx: Search dropdown z-index could conflict
  - WHY: Using z-10 for dropdown might not be sufficient if other elements use higher z-index values
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Use a consistent z-index scale (like z-50 for dropdowns) to avoid layering issues

### OPTIONAL CLEANUPS

- /frontend/src/index.css: Custom scrollbar styling only works in Webkit browsers
  - CONTEXT: The ::-webkit-scrollbar styles won't apply in Firefox, creating inconsistent experience across browsers

- /frontend/src/components/payment/PaymentForm.tsx: Form uses mix of Tailwind border utilities
  - CONTEXT: Using both border-gray-300 and focus:border-blue-500 could be simplified with Tailwind's ring utilities for cleaner focus states

- /frontend/tailwind.config.js: Unused color definitions in theme
  - CONTEXT: The navbar-dark class uses direct color values instead of the defined dark theme colors, making the dark color palette partially unused

## VITE-AGENT – Build System Audit

### CRITICAL ISSUES (must-fix, 89%+ confidence)

- **/frontend/vite.config.ts**: Missing production build configuration
  - WHY: No build.target specified, no build.rollupOptions for production optimizations, no CSS minification config, no source map strategy
  - EFFECT: Production builds use default settings which may produce larger bundles, slower loading times, and debugging difficulties in production

- **/frontend/src/api/client.ts & /frontend/src/stores/useAppStore.ts**: Environment variable fallback strategy breaks production
  - WHY: Both files use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || '/api'` but with different fallbacks ('http://localhost:8000' vs '/api'), causing API endpoint confusion
  - EFFECT: In production without VITE_API_URL set, useAppStore defaults to localhost:8000 (dev server) while ApiClient defaults to '/api' (proxy), causing immediate API failures

- **/frontend/package.json**: Vite 6.0.6 vs docs specify 5.4.11
  - WHY: Using Vite 6.0.6 while docs explicitly state to follow 5.4.11 patterns. Major version differences can have breaking changes
  - EFFECT: Potential incompatibilities with documented configurations, unexpected behavior differences between dev and production

### STRONGLY ADVOCATED IMPROVEMENTS

- **/frontend/vite.config.ts**: No build manifest generation for production deployments
  - WHY: Missing `build.manifest: true` prevents proper asset fingerprinting and cache busting in production
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Add build.manifest and build.rollupOptions.output configurations for production asset handling

- **/frontend/tsconfig.json**: TypeScript target ES2020 may be too conservative
  - WHY: Vite docs recommend esnext for better tree-shaking and smaller bundles
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Use build.target for browser compatibility, let TypeScript compile to latest for better optimization

- **/frontend/vite.config.ts**: Missing optimizeDeps configuration
  - WHY: No explicit dependency pre-bundling config can cause slow cold starts and HMR issues with large dependencies
  - CLEANER APPROACH: Add optimizeDeps.include for known heavy dependencies like react, react-dom

### OPTIONAL CLEANUPS

- **/frontend/index.html**: Using default Vite icon
  - CONTEXT: Still referencing /vite.svg as favicon - should use app-specific icon if branding matters

- **/frontend/vite.config.ts**: No CSP nonce configuration
  - CONTEXT: If deploying to environments with strict CSP policies, html.cspNonce would be needed

- **/frontend/postcss.config.js**: Using CommonJS export in ESM project
  - CONTEXT: Package.json specifies "type": "module" but PostCSS config uses old export syntax - works but inconsistent
