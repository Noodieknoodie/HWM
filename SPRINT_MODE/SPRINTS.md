# SPRINT MODE - 401k Payment Tracker Migration Sprints

# Check /OLD_CODE_INSPO for the existing app code (two monolithic combo files). The new implementation needs identical UI/UX - same layout, same style, verbatim - but adapted for the updated architecture. The Azure SQL DB simplifications make this migration cleaner, but you're not building from scratch. You're refactoring FRONTEND_COMPLEX.txt to fit the new requirements, with backend adjustments to match. Read every line of the old code before starting - understand what exists, then bridge to what's needed. LEARN WHAT THIS NEW APP CHANGES ARE BY READING CLAUDE_README.md

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: DATABASE IS ALREADY CONFIGURED ðŸš¨
**THE AZURE SQL DATABASE HAS BEEN FULLY UPDATED WITH ALL MODIFICATIONS.**
- âœ… All new tables (payment_periods, etc.) are ALREADY CREATED
- âœ… All views (payment_variance_view, clients_by_provider_view, etc.) are ALREADY CREATED  
- âœ… All indexes are ALREADY APPLIED
- âœ… All DATE column conversions are ALREADY COMPLETE
- âœ… All CHECK constraints are ALREADY IN PLACE
- âœ… The payment_periods table is ALREADY POPULATED (2015-2030)

**AGENTS MUST NOT MODIFY THE AZURE SQL DATABASE STRUCTURE IN ANY WAY!**

## Overview
This document contains the comprehensive sprint plan for migrating the 401k Payment Tracker from the complex Teams Toolkit/Azure Functions architecture to a clean React/FastAPI architecture. Each sprint has specific objectives, context from old code, and validation criteria.

**Note:** The database improvements mentioned throughout these sprints are for context only - they have already been implemented. Focus on using the existing database structure, not modifying it.

---

## SPRINT 1: Foundation & Project Setup
**Objective:** Set up project foundation and connect to the EXISTING database structure

### Context from Old Code:
- Backend has complex date string manipulation (parseISO, toISOString().split('T')[0])
- periods/__init__.py has 150+ lines generating periods on-the-fly
- calculations/__init__.py is an entire Azure Function just for variance calculations
- Repetitive JOINs in every client query

### Tasks:
1. Initialize clean project structure:
   - `/frontend` - React with Vite
   - `/backend` - FastAPI
   - `/teams-manifest` - Simple Teams manifest
   - Remove all Teams Toolkit configuration files

2. Connect to EXISTING database (DO NOT MODIFY):
   - Database already has `payment_periods` table (populated 2015-2030)
   - Database already has `payment_variance_view` 
   - Database already has `clients_by_provider_view`
   - Database already has composite index: `idx_payments_period_lookup`
   - All DATE columns are already proper DATE type
   - CHECK constraints are already in place

3. Set up backend foundation:
   - FastAPI app structure with proper routing
   - Database connection using pyodbc + Azure AD auth
   - Pydantic models matching EXISTING schema
   - CORS configuration for Teams
   - Create `.env.example` with template:
     ```
     AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING=Driver={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};Server=your-server.database.windows.net;Database=your-db;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryDefault;
     ```
   - Standardized error response format:
     ```python
     {"error": {"code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Human readable message"}}
     ```

### Validation:
- Can query EXISTING database views successfully
- FastAPI server starts successfully
- Can connect to Azure SQL with proper auth
- Pydantic models match EXISTING database schema

---

## SPRINT 2: Core API Endpoints - Clients & Contracts
**Objective:** Implement essential client and contract endpoints using new database views

### Context from Old Code:
- clients/__init__.py has complex manual JOINs that `clients_by_provider_view` eliminates
- Frontend groups clients by provider in JavaScript - now handled by view
- Contract endpoints duplicate client JOINs

### Tasks:
1. Implement client endpoints:
   - GET /api/clients - Use `clients_by_provider_view` (no manual JOINs!)
   - GET /api/clients/{id} - Single client with contract info
   - POST/PUT/DELETE /api/clients - CRUD operations

2. Implement contract endpoints:
   - GET /api/contracts/client/{client_id}
   - POST/PUT /api/contracts
   - Ensure soft deletes (valid_to timestamps)

3. Add proper error handling and validation

### Validation:
- Client list includes compliance_status from view
- No manual provider grouping needed
- Contract operations maintain referential integrity
- Soft deletes work correctly

---

## SPRINT 3: Payment Management & Smart Periods
**Objective:** Implement payment CRUD with simplified period logic

### Context from Old Code:
- periods/__init__.py generates periods dynamically (150+ lines)
- Split payment functionality removed - each payment = one period
- payments/__init__.py has complex expected fee calculations

### Tasks:
1. Implement payment endpoints:
   - GET /api/payments?client_id={id} - Use `payment_variance_view` for variance
   - POST /api/payments - Single period only
   - PUT/DELETE /api/payments
   - Remove ANY split payment logic
   - **CRITICAL**: Expected fee calculations MUST use SQL views ONLY
   - **NO** Python calculations for expected fees or variance
   - **NO** JavaScript calculations in frontend

2. Implement smart periods endpoint:
   - GET /api/periods - Simple JOIN against `payment_periods` table
   - Return only unpaid periods
   - No dynamic generation - just query the table!

3. Database triggers ALREADY handle metrics updates automatically

### Validation:
- Variance calculations come from view (not computed)
- Period dropdown loads instantly
- Each payment applies to exactly one period
- Triggers update client_metrics automatically

---

## SPRINT 4: Dashboard & Payment Status
**Objective:** Implement unified dashboard endpoint using optimized views

### Context from Old Code:
- dashboard/__init__.py makes multiple queries
- Complex current period calculations in Python
- Frontend calculates variance for each payment row

### Tasks:
1. Create dashboard endpoint:
   - GET /api/dashboard/{client_id}
   - Single query using views + new index
   - Return complete dashboard data structure

2. Leverage `client_payment_status` view:
   - Current period calculation in SQL
   - Binary status: Paid or Due (no red/overdue)
   - Expected fee from view

3. Remove calculations endpoint entirely:
   - Delete /api/calculations/variance
   - Variance comes from `payment_variance_view`

### Validation:
- Dashboard loads with single API call
- No client-side variance calculations
- Status is binary (green/yellow only)
- Fast query performance with new index

---

## SPRINT 5: Authentication & Teams Integration
**Objective:** Implement Azure AD authentication and Teams SSO

### Context from Old Code:
- Complex Teams Toolkit auth wrappers
- app.ts has Express server for Teams tab hosting

### Tasks:
1. Backend authentication:
   - JWT validation middleware
   - Azure AD token verification
   - Extract user context from Teams

2. Frontend authentication:
   - MSAL.js for Teams SSO
   - Silent token acquisition
   - Auth context/hooks

3. Simple Teams manifest:

   - Complete `manifest.json` structure:
     ```json
     {
       "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.16/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
       "manifestVersion": "1.16",
       "version": "1.0.0",

## Key Migration Principles (Reference for All Sprints)

1. **Simplification First**: Remove complexity, don't port it
2. **Trust the Database**: Use views, indexes, and proper data types
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Calculate once (in SQL), display everywhere
4. **Binary Status**: Only green (paid) or yellow (due) - no red/overdue
5. **No Split Payments**: One payment = one period, always
6. **Clean Architecture**: React + FastAPI + SQL, no middleware magic
7. **Performance**: Leverage new indexes and views for speed
8. **Maintainability**: Clear file structure, obvious patterns
9. **Date Handling**: 
   - Database columns are proper DATE type (not strings)
   - API communication uses ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - NO string manipulation for dates (no split('T')[0])
   - Let database handle date comparisons and calculations

## Success Metrics

- Period dropdown loads in <100ms (was 1-2 seconds)
- Dashboard loads with 1 API call (was 3-4)
- No client-side variance calculations
- No string date manipulation
- Codebase 50% smaller
- Zero Teams Toolkit dependencies
