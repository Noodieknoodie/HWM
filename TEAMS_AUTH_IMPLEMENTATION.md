  Yes, I'm familiar with Azure Data API Builder (DAB) for Azure SQL. Looking at your staticwebapp.database.config.json, you have it configured correctly with "provider":      
  "StaticWebApps".

  Here's the thing: DAB with SWA provider mode works by:
  1. Reading the X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL header that SWA injects
  2. Validating the user is authenticated via SWA's auth system
  3. Applying role-based permissions from your config

  The key issue: DAB in SWA mode expects the user to be authenticated through SWA's auth system, not just any Bearer token. When you send a Teams token as Bearer auth,        
  DAB won't know what to do with it because:
  - It's looking for SWA's session (via the principal header)
  - Teams tokens aren't automatically trusted by SWA

  Your current DAB config is correct for SWA auth. The problem is that Teams SSO tokens and SWA auth are two different auth systems that don't directly talk to each other     
   without a backend to bridge them.

  So the code I just wrote will likely fail when the Teams token hits DAB endpoints. The fallback to SWA auth will kick in, causing the redirect loop you were trying to       
  avoid.




  What’s really happening
Static Web Apps (SWA) Easy Auth trusts only the cookies/headers it issues after an interactive login or code flow.

Teams Tab SSO gives you a front-channel ID token meant for the Teams iframe. That JWT is not one of the tokens SWA Easy Auth recognises.

DAB in "provider":"StaticWebApps" mode simply asks Easy Auth, “Who is this caller and what roles do they have?” by reading X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL. If that header is missing or invalid, DAB tells Easy Auth to challenge, which shows up as the redirect loop you described.

Because the Teams token never becomes an SWA session cookie/header, DAB sees an unauthenticated request.

Options to make this work
Approach	Effort	Pros	Cons
1. Add a minimal API layer (Azure Function/App Service) that performs On-Behalf-Of (OBO): redeem the Teams token for an SWA-trusted token or call SQL directly.	Medium	- Works with existing Teams SSO.
- Keeps DAB config untouched.	- You now manage backend code.
- Slight latency.
2. Switch DAB to "provider":"AzureAD" and validate the Teams ID token directly.	Low-medium	- No extra service; DAB validates bearer JWT itself.	- Loses Easy Auth features (role mapping via SWA portal, social providers).
- You must configure issuer, audiences, and roles manually in DAB.
3. Use SWA’s built-in login instead of Teams SSO: open a silent SWA /login iframe inside Teams, then call DAB with the resulting SWA cookie.	Medium-high	- Stays fully “serverless.”
- DAB continues using SWA mode.	- Complex front-end dance; silent SWA login may break in some tenants.
- Two separate sign-in experiences (Teams & SWA).
4. Wait for Microsoft to add mutual trust between Teams and SWA tokens (road-map item).	Zero	- No work now.	- No timeline; blocks your project.
Recommended path today
Keep Teams SSO for the tab UI.

Add a tiny Azure Function (JavaScript or C#) with an HTTP trigger:

Accept the Teams token from the client.

Use OAuth 2.0 OBO to get either:
a) A Graph/SQL access token and run the query yourself, or
b) An Easy Auth-compatible token (not trivial—normally impossible).

Call this function from React instead of hitting /data-api directly.

Why not just flip DAB to "AzureAD"? You can, but you’ll lose the automatic role propagation from SWA and must reproduce it in DAB’s permissions. If your needs are simple (e.g., every signed-in user gets CRUD), that trade-off is acceptable and avoids writing a Function.

Quick checklist if you choose the Azure Function route
Create an App Registration with the Azure SQL Database scope or user_impersonation for your own API.

Grant it offline_access and any Graph scopes you need.

In the Function, use OnBehalfOfCredential from @azure/identity or MSAL to redeem the Teams token.

Execute SQL via the .query() endpoints (ADO.NET, Prisma, etc.) or forward results back to React.

Protect the Function route in staticwebapp.config.json with "allowedRoles":["authenticated"] so only logged-in Teams users can reach it.

Bottom line
Yes—your concern is valid. Teams SSO tokens are not accepted by SWA Easy Auth, so DAB in StaticWebApps mode will reject them. Introduce a lightweight backend or switch DAB to direct Azure AD validation; otherwise, the redirect loop persists.




====================

## Verification with Microsoft Documentation

### 1. Why Teams SSO tokens fail against Data API Builder in **StaticWebApps** mode  

| Claim from earlier reply | What Microsoft docs say | Alignment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SWA Easy Auth only trusts the session cookie/`X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL` header it issues. | “Data API builder expects Azure Static Web Apps authentication (EasyAuth) … and to provide metadata about the authenticated user in the `X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL` HTTP header when using the option `StaticWebApps`.” [1] | ✔ |
| A Teams tab token presented as `Authorization: Bearer ` is ignored because SWA never converts it to the Easy Auth session. | Same article explains that Easy Auth derives user context solely from its own headers; bearer tokens are not mentioned for SWA provider[1]. | ✔ |
| Result is DAB returning 302/redirect loop. | SWA auth docs show unauthenticated callers are redirected to `/.auth/login`[2]; DAB triggers that flow when header is missing[1]. | ✔ |

### 2. Options to resolve the mismatch  

| Option | Official guidance | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a. Add a small API that does On-Behalf-Of (OBO) to SQL/Graph. | Microsoft identity platform OBO flow described for middle-tier APIs needing downstream tokens[3]. | Docs endorse approach. |
| b. Switch DAB to `"AzureAD"` (JWT) mode and validate the Teams token directly. | DAB schema shows `"provider":"AzureAD"` with issuer/audience settings for bare JWT validation[1][4]. | Supported, but loses SWA features. |
| c. Use SWA login inside Teams iframe to acquire Easy Auth cookie. | SWA auth article documents `/login` endpoints and that authenticated cookies can be obtained client-side[2]. | Technically feasible but extra UX steps. |

### 3. “Backend required” statement for Graph or other downstream APIs  

| Earlier statement | Doc confirmation |
| --- | --- |
| “Any production Teams SSO scenario that exchanges the ID token for Graph scopes requires a server component.” | Teams SSO guide: after `getAuthToken()` the tab must send that token to a backend to redeem a Graph-scoped token via OBO[5]. | ✔ |

### 4. When **no backend is needed**  

| Scenario | Supporting doc |
| --- | --- |
| Displaying basic user info inside the tab using only the ID token. | Teams SSO sample shows parsing the token client-side for profile data, with no server exchange[5]. |
| CRUD through DAB when it trusts SWA headers (i.e., user logged in via SWA, not Teams token). | DAB StaticWebApps provider relies solely on Easy Auth header; once present, no extra backend code is needed for database CRUD[1]. |

### 5. Configuration snippets accuracy  

| File | Key setting | Doc reference | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `staticwebapp.database.config.json` | `"authentication": { "provider": "StaticWebApps" }` | Exact syntax shown in DAB config reference[1][4]. | ✔ |
| `staticwebapp.config.json` | Route rule with `"allowedRoles":["authenticated"]` | Route-based auth control is documented in SWA auth article[2]. | ✔ |
| Teams manifest example | `webApplicationInfo` field containing app ID & resource | Teams SSO manifest requirements list the same fields[5][6]. | ✔ |

### 6. Redirect-loop root cause restated with citations  

> Azure Static Web Apps treats each incoming call as anonymous unless the `X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL` header (set by Easy Auth after its own login) is present. Data API Builder in `StaticWebApps` mode therefore challenges any request that only carries a Teams SSO bearer token, causing the observed redirect cycle[2][1].

### Conclusion  

Reviewing Azure Static Web Apps, Data API Builder, Microsoft Entra OBO, and Teams SSO documentation confirms every material point made in the previous answers. The incompatibility between Teams-issued tokens and SWA Easy Auth is documented; the work-arounds suggested (OBO backend or switching DAB to JWT mode) are explicitly supported in Microsoft guidance.
